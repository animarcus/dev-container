# Dev container for easier remote development

This repo was originally intended for easier development and management of a homelab running on a Synology NAS.
It's a server I'm taking over, so I need a way to explore the files and configurations that are in a chosen folder.
This also allows me to use tools that I install on the container without worrying about bloating the host, and for testing things out.
