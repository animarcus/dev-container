# Workspace Directory

This directory is intended for your development projects. Its contents are ignored by git
to allow you to:

1. Keep projects as separate git repositories
2. Have local-only development folders
3. Maintain project-specific configurations

## Suggested Structure

```code
workspace/
├── c_projects/      # C development projects
│   ├── cs202/       # Course projects
│   └── personal/    # Personal C projects
└── other/           # Other projects
```

Feel free to organize your projects as needed - nothing in this directory except
this README will be tracked by the dev-container repository.
